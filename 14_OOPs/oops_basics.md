1. Objects are collections of properties and methods.
2. Classes are blueprints for creating objects, allowing encapsulation and inheritance.
3. Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
4. Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods, and controlling access to private data.
5. Polymorphism allows methods to behave differently depending on the object calling them.
6. Abstraction hides complex implementation details and exposes only the necessary parts.
